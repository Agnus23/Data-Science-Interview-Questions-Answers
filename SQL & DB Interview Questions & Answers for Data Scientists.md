## Questions & Answers ##

### Q1: What are joins in SQL and discuss its types? ###
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them. It is used to merge two tables or retrieve data from there. There are 4 types of joins: inner join left join, right join, and full join.

* Inner join: Inner Join in SQL is the most common type of join. It is used to return all the rows from multiple tables where the join condition is satisfied. 
* Left Join:  Left Join in SQL is used to return all the rows from the left table but only the matching rows from the right table where the join condition is fulfilled.
* Right Join: Right Join in SQL is used to return all the rows from the right table but only the matching rows from the left table where the join condition is fulfilled.
* Full Join: Full join returns all the records when there is a match in any of the tables. Therefore, it returns all the rows from the left-hand side table and all the rows from the right-hand side table.

### Q2: Define the primary, foreign, and unique keys and the differences between them? ###

**Primary key:** Is a key that is used to uniquely identify each row or record in the table, it can be a single column or composite pk that contains more than one column

* The primary key doesn't accept null or repeated values
* The purpose of the primary key is to keep the Entity's integrity
* There is only one PK in each table
* Every row must have a unique primary key

**Foreign key:** Is a key that is used to identify, show or describe the relationship between tuples of two tables. It acts as a cross-reference between tables because it references the primary key of another table, thereby establishing a link between them.

* The purpose of the foreign key is to keep data integrity
* It can contain null values or primary key values

**Unique key:** It's a key that can identify each row in the table as the primary key but it can contain one null value

* Every table can have more than one Unique key

### Q3: What is the difference between BETWEEN and IN operators in SQL? ###
Answer:

The SQL **BETWEEN** operator selects values within a given range. It is inclusive of both the ranges, begin and end values are included.  The values can be text, date, numbers, or other

For example, select * from tablename where price BETWEEN 10 and 100;

The **IN** operator is used to select rows in which a certain value exists in a given field. It is used with the WHERE clause to match values in a list.

For example, select COLUMN from tablename where 'USA' in (country);

IN is mainly best for categorical variables(it can be used with Numerical as well) whereas Between is for Numerical Variables

### Q4: Assume you have the given table below which contains information on user logins. Write a query to obtain the number of reactivated users (Users who did not log in the previous month and then logged in the current month) ###
![Alt_text](https://github.com/youssefHosni/Data-Science-Interview-Questions/blob/main/Figures/Screenshot%202022-07-31%20201033.png)

Answer: 
First, we look at all the users who did not log in during the previous month. To obtain the last month's data, we subtract an ùêàùêçùêìùêÑùêëùêïùêÄùêã of 1 month from the current month's login date. Then, we use ùêñùêáùêÑùêëùêÑ ùêÑùêóùêàùêíùêìùêí against the previous month's interval to check whether there was login in the previous month. Finally, we ùóñùó¢ùó®ùó°ùóß the number of users satisfying this condition.

```
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', current_month.login_date) AS current_month,
    COUNT(*) AS num_reactivated_users 
FROM 
    user_logins current_month
WHERE
    NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 
        *
      FROM 
        user_logins last_month
      WHERE
        DATE_TRUNC('month', last_month.login_date) BETWEEN DATE_TRUNC('month', current_month.login_date) AND DATE_TRUNC('month', current_month.login_date) - INTERVAL '1 month'
)
```
### Q5: Describe the advantages and disadvantages of relational database vs NoSQL databases ###

Answer:

**Advantages of Relational Databases:** Ensure data integrity through a defined schema and ACID properties.  Easy to get started with and use for small-scale applications. Lends itself well to vertical scaling.  Uses an almost standard query language, making learning or switching between types of relational databases easy.

**Advantages of NoSQL Databases:** Offers more flexibility in data format and representations, which makes working with Unstructured or semistructured data easier.  Hence, useful when still the data schema or adding new features/functionality rapidly like in a startup environment to scale with horizontal scaling.  Lends itself better to applications that need to be highly available. 

**Disadvantages of Relational Databases:** Data schema needs to be known in advance.  Ale schemas is possible, but frequent changes to the schema for large tables can cause performance issues.  Horizontal scaling is relatively difficult, leading to eventual performance bottlenecks

**Disadvantages of NoSQL Databases:** As outlined by the BASE framework, weaker guarantees of data correctness are made due to the soft-state and eventual consistency property.  Managing consistency can also be difficult due to the lack of a predefined schema that's strictly adhered to. Depending on the type of NoSQL database, it can be challenging for the database to handle its types of complex queries or access patterns.

### Q6: Assume you are given the table below on user transactions. Write a query to obtain the third transaction of every user ###

![1661352126442](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72076328/186479648-5dcbf0a3-46e3-46b4-99ab-94feeace3dca.png)

Answer:
First, we obtain the transaction numbers for each user. We can do this by using the ROW_NUMBER window function, where we PARTITION by the user_id and ORDER by the transaction_date fields, calling the resulting field a transaction number. From there, we can simply take all transactions having a transaction number equal to 3.

### Q7: What do you understand by Self Join? Explain using an example ###

Answer:

Self-join is as its name implies, joining a table to itself on a database, this process may come in handy in a number of cases, such as:

1- comparing the table's rows to themselves:

It's like we have two copies of the same table and join them together on a given condition to reach the required output query.

Ex. If we have a store database with a client's data table holding a bunch of demographics, we could self-join the client's table to get clients who are located in the same city/made a purchase on the same day/etc.

2- querying a table that has hierarchical data:

Meaning, the table has a primary key that has a one-to-many relationship with another foreign key inside the same table, in other words, the table has data that refers to the same table. We could use self-join in order to have a clear look at the data by matching its keys.

Ex. The organizational structure of a company may contain an employee table that has an employee id and his manager id (who is also an employee, hence has an employee id too) in the same table. Using self-join on this table would allow us to reference every employee directly to his manager.

P.S. we would need to take care of duplicates that may occur and consider them in the conditions.

### Q9: Write a SQL query to get the third-highest salary of an employee from employee_table and arrange them in descending order. ###

Answer:

### Q10: What is the difference between temporary tables and common table expressions? ###

Answer:

ùóßùó≤ùó∫ùóΩùóºùóøùóÆùóøùòÜ ùòÅùóÆùóØùóπùó≤ùòÄ and ùóñùóßùóòs are both used to store intermediate results in MySQL, but there are some key differences between the two:

ùóóùó≤ùó≥ùó∂ùóªùó∂ùòÅùó∂ùóºùóª: A temporary table is a physical table that is created in the database and persists until it is explicitly dropped or the session ends. A CTE is a virtual table that is defined only within the scope of a single SQL statement.

ùó¶ùòÅùóºùóøùóÆùó¥ùó≤: Temporary tables are stored in the database and occupy physical disk space. CTEs are not stored on disk and exist only in memory for the duration of the query.

ùóîùó∞ùó∞ùó≤ùòÄùòÄ: Temporary tables can be accessed from any session that has the appropriate privileges. CTEs are only accessible within the scope of the query in which they are defined.

ùóüùó∂ùó≥ùó≤ùòÄùóΩùóÆùóª: Temporary tables persist until they are explicitly dropped or the session ends. CTEs are only available for the duration of the query in which they are defined and are then discarded.

ùó¶ùòÜùóªùòÅùóÆùòÖ: Temporary tables are created using the CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE statement, while CTEs are defined using the WITH clause.

ùó£ùòÇùóøùóΩùóºùòÄùó≤: Temporary tables are typically used to store intermediate results that will be used in multiple queries, while CTEs are used to simplify complex queries by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.

In summary, temporary tables are physical tables that persist in the database and can be accessed from any session, while CTEs are virtual tables that exist only within the scope of a single query and are discarded once the query is complete. Both temporary tables and CTEs can be useful tools for simplifying complex queries and storing intermediate results.
